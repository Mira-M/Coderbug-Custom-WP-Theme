## Overview

This project is for my personal website that I have been overhauling for the past few weeks. This project is a full wordpress site with a custom theme 'coderbug' that I have been working on for the past few weeks.  This site uses Bootstrap, and other frameworks (below) to create a full blown responsive wordpress site.   

## Motivation

I have been wanting to redo this site for over a year and here is the progress of it so far.  The didn't originally use version control (whoops), but as I add more complex features I will going forward.  I am also very busy with school, work etc, so I needed a way to add portfolio and blog updates seemlessly and without having to tackle code, so having a Wordpress site made much more sense than doing one the traditional way.  The only issue was, **whoops**, I'd never created a wordpress site before.  So, this is in no way perfect, nor do I claim it to be -- I'll get better as I learn and I'll streamline the process.
